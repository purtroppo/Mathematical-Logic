# Lecture notes: Mathematical Logic

These are the lecture notes of the Mathematical Logic course I took last year at Ca' Foscari University of Venice. Notice that errors are surely present, notably in the second part on _topology_. I'm very sorry but the course was a bit of a mess. 

## Found an error? Drop a line

Drop me a line if you find an error. I'll be happy to correct it as soon as possible.
