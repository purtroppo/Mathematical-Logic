# Lecture notes: Mathematical Logic

These are the lecture notes of the Mathematical Logic course I took last year at Ca' Foscari University of Venice. Notice that there must be some errors here and there, especially in the second part on _topology_. I'm very sorry but the course was a bit of a mess. All the solved exercises are correct though.

## Found an error? 

Drop me a line if you find errors, mistakes or horrendous typos. I'll be happy to correct them as soon as possible.
